### Hi, I'm Nathan ğŸ‘‹

I'm interested in automating human decision making through machine learning. I see data engineering as the prevailing bottleneck in that process, and therefore spend most of my time thinking about ways to serve, monitor, and control model data.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations)

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++

ğŸ“« You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnathanfarmer/)
