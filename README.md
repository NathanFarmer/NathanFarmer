### Hi, I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I specialize in building software products that empower users to leverage data and AI systems. I enjoy bridging the gap between complex data models and practical, impactful applications.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently working on [GX Cloud](https://greatexpectations.io/cloud) at [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations)

ðŸŒ± Recently, I was involved in open sourcing [jsonforms-antd-renderers](https://github.com/great-expectations/jsonforms-antd-renderers)
